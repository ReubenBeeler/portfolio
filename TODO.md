## TODOs
- Big-Picture:
    - Design a structured view with navigation for bio, resume, social, projects, certifications, etc.
- Minor Tweaks:
    - Pan over the background at roughly half the rate of the foreground when scrolling (first make a scroll view!)
    - Implement drag-and-scroll for `ReubIcon`s within a parent `Scrollable`
    - Configure browser tab icon(s) and other similar settings
    - Add some kind of border around `ReubIcon` spotlights (inverse primary color?)
    - Set max speed on mouse-proximity animations to avoid spazzy UI if mouse spazzes.
    - Embellish EXPLORE with color gradient or animation of light shining through the letters
- Goofy Mode (make these icons feel ALIVE):
    - long/indefinite animation times
    - make noise on hover (louder + higher pitch closer to the center)
    - make icon shake or spin with increasing intensity
    - icon bouncing (some options):
        - keep some momentum when ending drag
        - allow icon to leave screen and regenerate it if too far gone
        - make animation super bouncy
        - make path follow planetary-like orbit around default position
        - let the icons collide/bounce off each other instead of z-stacking
        - move back along the same path traced by the mouse when dragging
